The conversion of file transfers to NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) commands when a host moves data to an NVMe SSD is typically handled by the NVMe driver and the operating system's storage stack. Here's a simplified breakdown of the process:

1. **File System Layer**: The host's file system receives the data transfer request.
2. **Operating System**: The OS handles the file system request and prepares the data for transfer. This involves translating high-level file system operations into block-level I/O operations.
3. **Storage Driver**: The NVMe driver, which is part of the OS, takes these block-level I/O operations and converts them into NVMe commands. These commands conform to the NVMe specification, which defines a command set and a protocol for communication with NVMe devices.
4. **NVMe Controller**: The NVMe controller on the SSD receives the NVMe commands from the host and executes them to read or write data to the non-volatile memory.

In summary, the NVMe driver in the operating system is primarily responsible for converting file transfers into NVMe commands that the NVMe SSD can understand and execute.
