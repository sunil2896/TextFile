### Summary:
1. **Higher Capacities Offer Better Write Speeds:** Across all examples, the 256 GB versions typically have lower write speeds compared to their 512 GB and 1 TB counterparts. This is because higher capacities often feature more NAND dies, allowing for increased parallelism in write operations.
2. **Increased IOPS:** The IOPS (especially write IOPS) tend to be higher in larger capacity SSDs, thanks to the increased number of NAND dies, which enable more concurrent read/write operations.
3. **Consistency in Read Speeds:** Read speeds often stay consistent across different capacities for high-performance SSDs like the Samsung 970 EVO Plus and WD Black SN850. However, SATA-based SSDs like the Crucial MX500 show minimal variance because the SATA interface is a limiting factor.
4. **Economies of Scale:** Larger capacity SSDs leverage better economies of scale in NAND dies usage, translating to improved performance metrics, particularly in write speeds and IOPS.

In conclusion, higher capacity SSDs typically provide better overall performance due to the increased number of NAND dies, which enhances data throughput and parallel processing capabilities.
