Sure, let's look at specific examples of SSDs where increased NAND dies have led to performance improvements:

### Samsung 970 EVO Plus
- **500GB vs. 1TB Models**:
  - The 500GB model typically has fewer NAND dies compared to the 1TB model.
  - **Performance**:
    - 500GB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 3,500/3,200 MB/s
    - 1TB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 3,500/3,300 MB/s
  - The 1TB model achieves slightly higher write speeds due to increased parallelism from more NAND dies.

### Western Digital WD Black SN750
- **500GB vs. 1TB Models**:
  - Similar to the Samsung 970 EVO Plus, the 1TB model has more NAND dies.
  - **Performance**:
    - 500GB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 3,430/2,600 MB/s
    - 1TB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 3,470/3,000 MB/s
  - Again, the 1TB model shows better write performance due to additional NAND dies allowing more efficient data interleaving and parallelism.

### Crucial MX500
- **500GB vs. 1TB Models**:
  - Both use the same controller but differ in the number of NAND dies.
  - **Performance**:
    - 500GB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 560/510 MB/s
    - 1TB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 560/510 MB/s
  - While sequential performance is similar, the 1TB model may exhibit better sustained write performance and endurance due to the increased number of NAND dies.

### Intel SSD 660p
- **512GB vs. 1TB Models**:
  - These SSDs utilize QLC NAND, which benefits significantly from more NAND dies.
  - **Performance**:
    - 512GB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 1,500/1,000 MB/s
    - 1TB: Sequential Read/Write speeds up to 1,800/1,800 MB/s
  - The 1TB model benefits from the increased NAND dies, showing substantial improvements in both read and write speeds.

In summary, increasing the number of NAND dies generally leads to better performance due to enhanced parallelism, improved bandwidth utilization, and more effective interleaving. These benefits are clearly observed in the higher capacity models of the same SSD series, which often show improved read/write speeds and better overall performance.
