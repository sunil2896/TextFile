### Analysis

1. **Sequential Read/Write Speeds**:
   - The 8-channel SSDs (Samsung 980 Pro and WD Black SN850) have significantly higher sequential read and write speeds compared to the 4-channel SSDs (Samsung 970 EVO Plus and WD Blue SN550). The read speeds are almost double, and write speeds are noticeably higher.

2. **Random Read/Write IOPS**:
   - The 8-channel SSDs exhibit much higher IOPS, making them more suitable for applications requiring rapid access to small data chunks. For instance, the Samsung 980 Pro can handle up to 1,000,000 random read IOPS, which is significantly higher than the 620,000 IOPS of the Samsung 970 EVO Plus.

3. **Latency**:
   - SSDs with 8 FIM channels generally have lower latency due to their ability to process more data in parallel, leading to quicker data access times. Both the Samsung 980 Pro and WD Black SN850 have latencies around 0.05 ms, compared to the ~0.1 ms for the 4-channel counterparts.

### Conclusion

SSDs with 8 FIM channels provide superior performance across most metrics compared to those with 4 FIM channels. They offer higher read/write speeds, greater IOPS, and lower latency, making them better suited for high-performance applications such as gaming, video editing, and data-intensive tasks.

These improvements come at a higher cost, so the choice between 4 and 8 FIM channel SSDs should consider both budget and performance needs. For everyday computing tasks, 4 FIM channel SSDs may be sufficient, while for demanding applications, investing in 8 FIM channel SSDs could be worthwhile.
